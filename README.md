## Project

**Problem:** **Most diet apps are manual and generic, you get the same meal suggestions as everyone else, regardless of whether your heart rate is elevated, your blood oxygen is low, or you're diabetic. Calories are treated as equal, even when they're not.Basically the physiological data is not considered while suggesting meals.**

**Solution:** **NutriSync AI is a real-time nutrition ecosystem that reads your physiological state and recommends meals based on how food will actually interact with your body right now — not just how many calories it contains.**

At the core is a **10 parameter dynamic health score** heart rate, SpO₂, HRV, stress, steps, BMI, calorie intake, medical risk, goal alignment, and glycemic index — where weights automatically redistribute based on your medical history and live vitals, always summing to 100. This score maps to one of five tiers (Peak → Critical), and each tier sends a completely different prompt to the AI, changing its entire nutritional strategy.

Every meal comes with a **Glycemic Impact Score** that goes beyond GI and GL it factors in protein buffering, fiber content, anti-spike ingredients, medical conditions, and live vitals like cortisol-glucose interaction during high stress. Two meals with identical calories can score 78 and 31, and the app tells you exactly why.

A **Full Day Plan** generates breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, an exercise schedule, and a hydration plan in one tap — all driven by morning vitals. Everything syncs to the cloud in real time so your profile and diary follow you across devices. The architecture is wearable-ready simulated vitals swap to Apple HealthKit or Google Fit with a single API change.
